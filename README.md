<h1>ANZ Australia Cyber Security Management Job Simulation</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I recently participated in ANZ's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a cybersecurity team at ANZ.
I worked on a project to identify cybersecurity threats and practiced identifying phishing emails and analyzing a packet capture file in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working on complex security threats and I’m excited to apply these skills on a cybersecurity team at a company.

* Completed a simulation focussed on identifying cybersecurity threats at ANZ 
* Investigated e-mails to report suspicious items 
* Analyzed a Packet Capture file using an open source tool to identify and investigate any potential threats
